Return non-nil when enabled, otherwise nil.


Tips for customizations

By the design policy, Mozc maintains most of user settings on
the server side.  Clients, including mozc.el, of Mozc do not
have many user settings on their side.

You can change a variety of user settings through a GUI command
line tool 'mozc_tool' which must be shipped with the mozc server.
The command line tool may be installed to /usr/lib/mozc or /usr/lib
directory.
You need a command line option '--mode=config_dialog' as the
following.

  $ /usr/lib/mozc/mozc_tool --mode=config_dialog

Then, it shows a GUI dialog to edit your user settings.

Note these settings are effective for all the clients of Mozc,
not limited to mozc.el.

Only the customizable item on mozc.el side is the key map for kana
input.  When you've chosen kana input rather than roman input,
a kana key map is effective, and you can customize it.

There are two built-in kana key maps, one for 106 JP keyboards and
one for 101 US keyboards.  You can choose one of them by setting
`mozc-keymap-kana' variable.

  ;; for 106 JP keyboards
  (setq mozc-keymap-kana mozc-keymap-kana-106jp)

  ;; for 101 US keyboards
  (setq mozc-keymap-kana mozc-keymap-kana-101us)

For advanced users, there are APIs for more detailed customization
or even creating your own key map.
See `mozc-keymap-get-entry', `mozc-keymap-put-entry',
`mozc-keymap-remove-entry', and `mozc-keymap-make-keymap' and
`mozc-keymap-make-keymap-from-flat-list'.
